# embedded-mini-projects
This repository contains a growing collection of small, self-contained embedded systems projects focused on microcontroller programming, real-time systems, and peripheral communication. Each project demonstrates a core embedded concept using FreeRTOS, ESP-IDF, STM32 HAL, or bare-metal C.

These mini-projects are intentionally scoped for fast iteration and deep learning â€” ideal for building real-world skills and showcasing practical firmware experience.

##  Project Structure

Each subfolder contains a standalone project with its own code, README, and build instructions.

---

##  Goals

- Deepen understanding of RTOS concepts: tasks, queues, semaphores, timing
- Interface with real hardware and sensors
- Build a foundation for more advanced projects 
- Showcase relevant firmware skills to recruiters and collaborators
